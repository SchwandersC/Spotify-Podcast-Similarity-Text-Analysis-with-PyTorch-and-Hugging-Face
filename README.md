# Spotify-Podcast-Similarity-Text-Analysis-with-PyTorch-and-Hugging-Face
Using popular NLP packages and frameworks I disect the Spotify R&D 100,000 podcast dataset and devise a method for finding similar podcasts based on content.

  # Within this file there are notebooks I used to extract information. Tokenize and embed text. And combine for analysis using cosine similarity and a siamese neural network in PyTorch. 
  Plans for future: 
  1. Make NN more robust
  2. Increase size of data from around 25,000 to full 100,000
